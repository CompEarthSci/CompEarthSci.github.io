We'll meet nearly every week in term time at 15:00 on Wednesdays in the Conference 
Room or Seminar room 1.  Meetings are open to all in the Department and will follow the schedule 
below that will be filled out early in term. If you are willing to lead one of these
sessions please let Andrew Walker know.

The Conference Room in Earth Sciences can be found on O4 (turn right after
you go through the doors to the office corridor). The seminar rooms are next
to reception on the ground floor.
