We'll meet approximatly every other week in term time normally at 15:00 in the Conference 
Room. Sometimes we meet in the seminar rooms. Meetings are open to all in the Department and will follow the schedule 
below that will be filled out early in term.
The Conference Room in Earth Sciences can be found on O4 (turn right after
you go through the doors to the office corridor). The seminar rooms are next to reception on the ground floor.
If you are willing to lead one of these sessions please let Andrew Walker know.
