As previously discussed, this week we will spend some time looking at how to use github pages to create webpages. As a vehicle to do this, we will create a space to help organise our meetings.

We'll meet at 15:00 on Thursday 21 September in the conference room on O4. It'll be a good idea to bring a laptop if you have one. Also bring knowledge of your github username and password, and any expertise you have in using Jekyll or Github Pages. The idea is to update this site. I'll start by sharing what little I know about how Github Pages works (and show how I use it for some code documentation) then we will experiment. I've linked to some resources that may turn out to be useful below.

Potentially useful resources:

* Our hackmd page [for the previous schedule](https://hackmd.io/bczLsf0bSquiTuhO5y-zwA) and [repository from 2021](https://github.com/CompEarthSci/CompEarthSci).
* The [github pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/pages).
* A collection of [themes for github pages](https://github.com/pages-themes) in case we want to make it look nice, I kind of like [midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight) but that's up for debate.
* kbroman's [simple_site example](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site)
